## Project Description
We wanted to replicate our favorite card game,the classic game of blackjack or 21 .You will play against the computer and whoever gets the score closest to 21 and not higher than this, will be the winner.This can be played by running the code "file blacjack.py" from a terminal, or if you prefer in the notebook "Code practice.ipynb".In the link below you can find these files.

## Workflow
Here you can see the flowchart we follow for the development of the game code.
